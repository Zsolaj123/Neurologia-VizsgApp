# Feature Specification: Neurology Exam Preparation Webapp

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-webapp`  
**Created**: 2025-09-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build a webapp that helps students preparing for a neurology exam. its in hungarian. The template with the style, content is in the folder called template_reszvizsga_app. in the first iteration i only want it to properly load and style the source markdown documents for each topic (kidolgozott tételek 1-259, some of htem bundled by 2 together, especially in the end). User may load in tétels, from a menu, and the loaded in topic has a tartalomjegyzék on the side for easy navigation, separate windows to load in summary (összefoglalás) and pictures of that topic. other features will later be implemented, but this first one is the foundation"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A medical student preparing for their neurology exam opens the webapp to study. They select a topic (tétel) from the menu, such as "Tétel 15: Stroke kezelése". The selected topic's content loads in the main area with formatted text from the markdown document. A table of contents (tartalomjegyzék) appears on the side, allowing them to quickly jump to specific sections within the topic. They can also open the topic's summary (összefoglalás) and view related images in separate panels to enhance their understanding while studying.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a student is on the webapp home page, **When** they select a topic from the menu, **Then** the corresponding markdown content is displayed with proper formatting
2. **Given** a topic is loaded, **When** the student clicks on a section in the table of contents, **Then** the page scrolls to that section
3. **Given** a topic is loaded, **When** the student clicks to view the summary, **Then** the summary content opens in a separate window/panel
4. **Given** a topic is loaded, **When** the student clicks to view images, **Then** all related images for that topic are displayed in a separate window/panel
5. **Given** the webapp is in Hungarian, **When** a student uses any feature, **Then** all interface elements, menus, and labels are displayed in Hungarian

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a topic's markdown file is missing or corrupted?
- How does system handle topics that are bundled together (e.g., topics near the end)?
- What happens if a topic has no summary or images available?
- How does the system handle malformed markdown content?
- What happens when switching between topics rapidly?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a menu listing all available topics (tételek 1-259)
- **FR-002**: System MUST load and render markdown content for selected topics with proper formatting
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate a navigable table of contents (tartalomjegyzék) from topic headings
- **FR-004**: System MUST support bundled topics where multiple topics are combined in one document
- **FR-005**: System MUST display topic summaries (összefoglalás) in a separate window/panel when requested
- **FR-006**: System MUST display topic-related images in a separate window/panel when requested
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve the existing template styling from template_reszvizsga_app folder
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide all interface elements in Hungarian language
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how to handle topics without summaries or images - show empty panel, hide option, or show message?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: minimum/maximum number of simultaneous open windows/panels]
- **FR-011**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: persist user state between sessions - remember last viewed topic, open panels?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Topic (Tétel)**: Represents a single exam topic with an ID (1-259), title, markdown content, optional summary, and optional images
- **Topic Bundle**: Represents multiple topics combined into a single document (particularly for topics near the end of the range)
- **Table of Contents**: Dynamically generated navigation structure based on topic headings
- **Summary (Összefoglalás)**: Optional condensed version of a topic's content
- **Topic Images**: Collection of images associated with a specific topic
