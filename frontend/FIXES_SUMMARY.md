# Neurology Exam App - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **"by Zsolaj" Text Positioning**
- **Problem**: The text was part of the main title with no separate styling
- **Solution**: 
  - Split the title into main text and author credit span
  - Added `.author-credit` class with smaller font size (0.9rem)
  - Positioned absolutely to the right within the title container
  - Applied muted color and reduced opacity for subtle appearance

### 2. **Sidebars Not Sticky**
- **Problem**: Despite having `position: sticky`, sidebars weren't sticking due to parent container overflow issues
- **Solution**:
  - Removed overflow restrictions from `#app-container`
  - Ensured parent containers (`#left-sidebar`, `#right-sidebar`) have `overflow: visible`
  - Set explicit heights for sticky sidebars: `height: calc(100vh - var(--header-height))`
  - Added `!important` declarations to override any conflicting styles

### 3. **TOC Highlighting on Scroll**
- **Problem**: Scroll event listener wasn't properly attached or debounced
- **Solution**:
  - Created `fixes.js` to properly attach scroll event listener
  - Implemented proper debouncing (50ms) to prevent performance issues
  - Enhanced the `updateActiveFromScroll` method to ensure active items are visible
  - Added smooth scrolling behavior and proper scroll margins for headers
  - Enhanced visual feedback with background color and border for active items

### 4. **Toggle Buttons Not Visible**
- **Problem**: Toggle buttons had visibility issues due to CSS conflicts
- **Solution**:
  - Increased button size to 45x45px for better visibility
  - Added glow effect with box-shadow
  - Implemented smooth transform animations for show/hide
  - Fixed z-index to ensure buttons appear above other content
  - Added hover effects with scaling and enhanced glow
